### Lecture 28: **Cut Capacities, Max Flow, and Matching Problems**

---

### 1. **Cut Capacities and Flow Values**

In this lecture, a more in-depth discussion of **cut capacities** and **flow values** was introduced. Let's break down the key concepts:

- A **cut** K in a directed graph D separates the graph into two sets, S and T, where S contains the source sss and T contains the sink t.
- The capacity of a cut KKK is the sum of the capacities of the edges from S to $TTT:C(K)=i∈S∑j∈T∑C(i,j)$
    
    This equation sums over all edges from a vertex in S to a vertex in T.
    
    这个选中的部分讨论了切割容量和流值的概念。以下是主要内容的中文解释：
    
    - **切割（Cut）**：在有向图中，切割K将图分为两个集合S和T，其中S包含源点s，T包含汇点t。
    - **切割容量（Cut Capacity）**：切割K的容量是从S到T的所有边的容量之和。这个总和计算了从S中的顶点到T中的顶点的所有边的容量。
    
    这些概念是网络流理论中的重要基础，用于分析和解决最大流问题。切割容量与流值之间的关系是理解最大流-最小切割定理的关键。

### 2. **Theorem: Cut Capacity is at least Flow Value**

The theorem presented states that the capacity of a cut is always greater than or equal to the flow value:

$C(K) \geq v(F)$

where $v(F)$  is the value of the flow.

**Proof Outline**:

1. The flow conservation principle ensures that the total flow out of the source equals the flow into the sink.
2. Since the flow on each edge $(i,j)$ is limited by the capacity $C(i,j)$, we can deduce that the total flow is constrained by the cut's capacity.
3. As a result, the total flow through any cut cannot exceed its capacity.

### 3. **Max Flow - Min Cut Theorem**

The **Max Flow - Min Cut Theorem** is a central result in network flow theory. It states that:

$\text{Max Flow} = \text{Min Cut}$

This means the maximum flow through a network equals the capacity of the smallest cut that separates s from t.

For equality to hold:

- All flow values must saturate the cut edges from S to T.
- No flow should be going in the reverse direction from T to S.

**Proof Insight**: The proof follows from examining the cut condition and flow values at each step of the flow augmentation process, showing that when the flow saturates the minimal cut, no more augmenting paths exist, and the flow is maximal.

### 4. **Finding Minimal Cuts Using the Complete Algorithm**

The **Complete Algorithm** helps to find a **minimal cut** in a flow network. It identifies a set of labeled and unlabeled vertices at the end of the algorithm and determines the minimal cut based on this partition:

- **S**: Labeled vertices.
- **T**: Unlabeled vertices.

At termination:

- All edges from S to T must be saturated (flow equals capacity).
- All edges from T to S must have zero flow.

Thus, the minimal cut K is given by the edges that connect SSS to T.

### 5. **Example: Minimal Cut via Complete Labeling Algorithm**

Consider a flow network where vertices $S = \{s, a, b, c\}$ and $T = \{d, t\}$, the minimal cut K consists of edges $(c, d)$ and $(b,t)$, which separate sss from ttt with the minimal possible capacity.

### 6. **Matching Problems**

In the final section, the lecture discusses **matching problems**, which involve assigning applicants (vertices in set SSS) to jobs (vertices in set T).

A matching problem seeks to find the maximal one-to-one correspondence between elements of S and T. This can be approached using network flow algorithms:

1. **Conversion to Max Flow Problem**: Construct a digraph with a source connected to all applicants and a sink connected to all jobs. Each edge has a capacity of 1.
2. **Max Flow Solution**: The maximal flow in this digraph corresponds to the maximal matching in the original problem.

**Example**: In a scenario with four applicants and five jobs, the matching function might pair $(A, K)$, $(B, N)$， and  $(C, J)$, maximizing the number of people assigned to jobs.

---

### 7. **Solving Matching Problems**

While small matching problems can be solved manually, the **vertex labeling algorithm** becomes essential for larger problems, allowing the algorithm to "undo" earlier pairings and find a better overall solution.

By converting the matching problem into a flow network, the **Complete Algorithm** can identify the maximal set of matchings by finding flows between applicants and jobs.
