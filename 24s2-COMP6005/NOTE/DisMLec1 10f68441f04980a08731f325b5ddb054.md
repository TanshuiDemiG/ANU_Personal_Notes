### **Statements: The Basic Unit of Logic**

A statement is a sentence that is true or false but not both.

**Examples of statements:**

- Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere.
- Tropical storms spin clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.
- Canberra is in New Zealand.
- (3 > 2)
- If 2 divides 4238 and 3 divides 4238, then 6 divides 4238.

---

### **Introducing Symbols for Statements**

In logic, we sometimes use variables to save time and space, and to clarify the logical structure of a compound statement.

**Example:** Let (p) denote "Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere."

---

### **Statement Variables and Statement Forms**

A variable that represents an arbitrary statement is called a statement variable. Expressions built using statement variables, parentheses, and logical connectives are called statement forms if they become statements when actual statements are substituted for the component statement variables.

**Examples:** Let (p) and (q) be statement variables.

- (q ∨ ¬(p ∧ q)) is a statement form.
- (p ¬ ∧ q) is not a statement form (just like (x + × y) is not an algebraic expression).

---

### **Logical Connectives**

### **NOT (¬)**

If (p) is a statement variable, the negation of (p), denoted (¬p), is defined by the following truth table:

| ( p ) | ( $\neg p$ ) |
| --- | --- |
| T | F |
| F | T |

### **AND (∧)**

If (p) and (q) are statement variables, the conjunction of (p) and (q), denoted (p ∧ q), is defined by the following truth table:

| (p) | (q) | (p ∧ q) |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T | T | T |  |
| T | F | F |  |
| F | T | F |  |
| F | F | F |  |

### **OR (∨)**

If (p) and (q) are statement variables, the disjunction of (p) and (q), denoted (p ∨ q), is defined by the following truth table:

| ( p ) | ( q ) | ( p \lor q ) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T | T | T |
| T | F | T |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | F |

### **XOR (⊕)异或**

If (p) and (q) are statement variables, the exclusive disjunction of (p) and (q), denoted (p ⊕ q), is defined by the following truth table:

| ( p ) | ( q ) | $( p \oplus q )$ |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T | T | F | 同为伪 |
| T | F | T |  |
| F | T | T |  |
| F | F | F |  |

---

### **Implication (IMPLIES) (→)**

If (p) and (q) are statement variables, the conditional of (q) by (p), denoted (p → q), is defined by the following truth table:

| ( p ) | ( q ) | ( p $\rightarrow$ q ) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | T |

There is extra vocabulary associated with conditionals. In the statement form (p → q), we call (p) the hypothesis (or antecedent) and (q) the conclusion (or consequent).

---

### **Biconditional (IFF) (↔)**

If (p) and (q) are statement variables, the biconditional of (p) and (q), denoted (p ↔ q), is defined by the following truth table: 

| ( p ) | ( q ) | ( p $\leftrightarrow$ q ) |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T | T | T |  |
| T | F | F |  |
| F | T | F |  |
| F | F | T |  |

---

### **Order of Precedence Among Connectives**

When evaluating a statement form:

1. Obey parentheses over any precedence rule
2. Evaluate (¬) first
3. Evaluate (∧), (∨), and (⊕) second. Parentheses may be needed when more than one is present.
4. Evaluate (→) and (↔) third. Parentheses may be needed when both are present.

When writing statement forms, always use parentheses to avoid ambiguity. For example: [p ∧ (q ∨ r) instead of p ∧ q ∨ r

---

### **Example: A Truth Table for a Statement Form**

Let's write a truth table for ((p ∧ q) ∨ (¬p ∧ ¬r)).

First, note that:

- The table needs a row for every combination of truth values among the statement variables. Given three variables, the table will need (2³ = 8) rows.
- We need to obey the order of precedence among logical connectives as we evaluate the truth value of the statement form.

**Method 1: Extra Columns**

| ( p ) | ( q ) | ( r ) | ( $p \land q$ ) | ( $\neg p$ ) | ( $\neg r$ ) | $( \neg p \land \neg r )$ | $( (p \land q) \lor (\neg p \land \neg r) )$ |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T | T | T | T | F | F | F | T |  |
| T | T | F | T | F | T | F | T |  |
| T | F | T | F | F | F | F | F |  |
| T | F | F | F | F | T | F | F |  |
| F | T | T | F | T | F | F | F |  |
| F | T | F | F | T | T | T | T |  |
| F | F | T | F | T | F | F | F |  |
| F | F | F | F | T | T | T | T |  |

**Method 2: Align T/F under Connectives**

| ( p ) | ( q ) | ( r ) | ((p $\land$ q) $\lor$ ($\neg$ p $\land$ $\neg$ r)) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T | T | T | T |
| T | T | F | T |
| T | F | T | F |
| T | F | F | F |
| F | T | T | F |
| F | T | F | T |
| F | F | T | F |
| F | F | F | T |
- Be careful because this method leaves less of a record of your working.
- Bold, circle, or highlight the column with the final result.

这段文字提醒我们在使用第二种方法（直接在连接词下方对齐T/F）制作真值表时要注意两点：

- 要小心使用这种方法，因为它留下的工作记录较少。这意味着如果你需要检查或解释你的工作过程，可能会比较困难。
- 应该将最终结果所在的列加粗、画圈或高亮显示。这样可以让最终结果更加清晰，便于快速识别。

这些建议旨在确保你在使用简化方法时不会丢失重要信息，并能清楚地展示最终结果。

### **Tautologies永真**

A statement form that is true regardless of the truth values of its variables is called a tautology.

**Examples:**

- The statement form (p ∨ ¬p) is a tautology as shown by:

| [p | ¬p | p ∨ ¬p |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T | F | T |
| F | T | T |
- The statement "(√2) is negative or non-negative" is a tautology because it is an instance of the statement form (p ∨ ¬p) with (p) representing "(√2) is negative."

---

### **Contradictions矛盾**

A statement form that is false regardless of the truth values of its variables is called a contradiction.

**Examples:**

- The statement form (p ∧ ¬p) is a contradiction.
- The statement "Australia is in the southern hemisphere and not in the southern hemisphere" is a contradiction.
- The statement "Australia is in the northern hemisphere" is not a contradiction.

### **Suggested Activities**

- Ensure you know how to watch videos and download frames from the ECHO360 system. Do this by watching Lecture 0 and downloading the frames for Lectures 0 and 1.
- Master the vocabulary introduced in this lecture and practice making truth tables for complex statement forms.
- Find the ebook of our optional text in the ANU library catalogue and see what you think.
- Look at the materials, including the practice problems, in the week 1 section on Wattle.
