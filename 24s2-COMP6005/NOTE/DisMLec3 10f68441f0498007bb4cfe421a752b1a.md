### **Section A1: Logic (continued)**

### **Logic Circuits**

Let’s engage in some discrete mathematical modelling.

---

### **Circuits**

电路

It has two possible states:

- Light ON
- Light OFF

The states correspond to the values True and False of the statement “the light is ON.”

### **Circuits: AND圆**

Here's a visual representation of the AND gate truth table:

```
+---+---+-------------+
| p | q | Light is ON |
+---+---+-------------+
| T | T |      T      |
| T | F |      F      |
| F | T |      F      |
| F | F |      F      |
+---+---+-------------+
```

This table shows all possible combinations of inputs (p and q) and their corresponding outputs for an AND gate circuit.

### **The AND Gate**

The circuit (p $\land$ q):

- Takes two inputs (states of switches (p) and (q))
- Produces one output (state of the light bulb)

The input-output table and symbol for the AND gate:

 $\begin{array}{c|c|c} p & q & p \land q \\ \hline 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \end{array}$

### **The OR Gate尖**

The circuit (p $\lor$ q):

- Takes two inputs (states of switches (p) and (q))
- Produces one output (state of the light bulb)

The input-output table and symbol for the OR gate:

$\begin{array}{c|c|c} p & q & p \lor q \\ \hline 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \end{array}$ 

---

### **The NOT Gate小圈**

![image.png](DisMLec3%2010f68441f0498007bb4cfe421a752b1a/image%202.png)

The NOT gate has the following table and symbol:

[ $\begin{array}{c|c} p & \neg p \\ \hline 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\ \end{array} ]$

---

### **Combining Gates**

Gates can be combined to create a circuit corresponding to a given compound statement.

**Example:**

$[ X, \quad Y \ ] [ Z = \neg X \land Y ]$

---

### **NAND and the NAND Gate 圆小圈**

![image.png](DisMLec3%2010f68441f0498007bb4cfe421a752b1a/image%203.png)

The logical connective NAND (NOT AND) is denoted by ( $p \uparrow q$ ) (or sometimes ( $p|$q )).

$[ p \uparrow q \equiv \neg (p \land q) ]$

A corresponding NAND gate is defined as follows:

$[ \begin{array}{c|c|c} X & Y & X \uparrow Y \\ \hline 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \end{array} ]$

---

# **The Functional Completeness of NAND**

Claim: The set (${\uparrow}$) is a functionally complete set of connectives. Every gate is equivalent to one that can be constructed by combining NAND gates alone.

---

### **NOT from NAND**

**Example:**

[ $\neg X \equiv X \uparrow X$ ]

---

### **AND from NAND**

![image.png](DisMLec3%2010f68441f0498007bb4cfe421a752b1a/image%205.png)

[ $X \land Y \equiv \neg (X \uparrow Y) \equiv (X \uparrow Y) \uparrow (X \uparrow Y)$ ]

The simplified circuit can use fewer NAND gates.

---

### **Recognizer Circuits**

Consider the circuit and corresponding table below:

[ $X, \quad \neg Y, \quad \neg Z \ \text{Output:} \ X \land \neg Y \land \neg Z$ ]

[ $\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} X & Y & Z & X \land \neg Y \land \neg Z \\ \hline 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \end{array}$ ]

A circuit that outputs 1 only for the input combination ((X, Y, Z) = (1, 0, 0)) is a recognizer for that input combination.

### **Predicate Logic 谓词逻辑**

### **Predicates**

A predicate is a sentence containing one or more variables, which becomes a statement when a value from a specified domain is given to each variable.

**Example:** [ $p(x) : x \text{ is a bird}$ ] Defined over the domain of animals. If ( $x = \text{cockatoo}$ ), then ( p(x) = T ). Further, ( $p(\text{shark}) = F$ ) and ( p(17@#) ) is undefined.

---

### **Quantifiers**

There are two ways to turn a predicate ( p(x) ) into a statement:

1. Specify a value for ( x )
2. Quantify ( x )
    
    根据选定的文本，我可以为您解释两种将谓词转换为陈述句的方法：
    
    1. 为变量 x 指定一个具体的值
    2. 对变量 x 进行量化
    
    这两种方法允许我们将包含变量的谓词转换为可以判断真假的陈述句。在逻辑和数学中，这是一个非常重要的概念，因为它允许我们从一般性的表达转向具体的陈述。
    

---

### **The Universal Quantifier**

The universal quantifier $( \forall$ ) is read “for all” or “for every.”

Universal statement $( \forall x$ , p(x) ) means “for all ( x ) (in the domain), ( p(x) ) is true.”

---

### **The Existential Quantifier**

The existential quantifier ( $\exists$ ) is read “there exists” or “for at least one.”

Existential statement ( $\exists x , p(x)$ ) means “there exists an ( x ) (in the domain) such that ( p(x) ) is true.”

---

### **Examples**

Consider the predicate ( $p(x) : x \text{ is a bird}$ ), with ( x ) taking values from the domain (${\text{cockatoo, parrot, shark}}$):

1. ( $\forall x , p(x)$ )
    
    The statement reads: “For all ( x ) in the set (${\text{cockatoo, parrot, shark}}$), ( x ) is a bird.” This is false because a shark is not a bird.
    
2. ( $\exists x , p(x)$ )
    
    The statement reads: “There is at least one ( x ) in the set (${\text{cockatoo, parrot, shark}}$) such that ( x ) is a bird.” This is true because a cockatoo is a bird.
    
3. ( $\exists! x , p(x)$ )
    
    The statement reads: “There is exactly one ( x ) in the set (${\text{cockatoo, parrot, shark}}$) such that ( x ) is a bird.” This is false because two animals (cockatoos and parrots) in the domain are birds.
    
4. ( $\exists! x \neg p(x)$ )
    
    The statement reads: “There is exactly one ( x ) in the set (${\text{cockatoo, parrot, shark}}$) such that ( x ) is not a bird.” This is true because only one animal (shark) in the domain is not a bird.
    

---

### **Additional Examples**

Consider the predicate ( q(x) : x \text{ is in Australia} ), with ( x ) taking values from the domain ( D = {\text{Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth}} ):

1. ( $\forall x , q(x)$ )
    
    This is true because every city in ( D ) is in Australia.
    
2. ( $\exists x , q(x)$ )
    
    This is true because Adelaide is in Australia.
    
3. ( $\exists! x , q(x)$ )
    
    This is false because more than one city in ( D ) is in Australia.
    
4. ( $\exists! x \neg q(x)$ )
    
    This is false because there are no cities in ( D ) that are not in Australia.
    

---

### **Example**

With domain the set of users (of some online system): 

[ \begin{align*} \text{o}(x) &: x \text{ is online} \ \text{c}(x) &: x \text{ has changed status} \ \text{u}(x) &: x \text{ has uploaded pictures} \end{align*} ]

$\begin{cases} \text{o}(x) &: x \text{ is online}, \\\text{c}(x) &: x \text{ has changed status}, \\\text{u}(x) &: x \text{ has uploaded pictures}.\end{cases}$

Express the following statements symbolically:

1. All users are online. ( $\forall x , o(x)$ )
2. No user has changed status. ( $\forall x \neg c(x)$ )
3. All users who have changed status have uploaded pictures. ( $\forall x , (c(x) \rightarrow u(x))$ )
4. Some users have changed status. ( $\exists x , c(x)$ )
5. Only one user has not uploaded pictures. ( $\exists! x \neg u(x)$ )

---

### **Notation: ( $\Rightarrow$ ) and ( $\Leftrightarrow$ ) 推出/等价**

Let ( p(x) ) and ( q(x) ) be predicates with the common domain ( D ):

p(x) $\Rightarrow q(x)$ & $\text{ is short for }$ $\forall x , (p(x) \rightarrow q(x))$ 
$p(x) \Leftrightarrow q(x)$ & $\text{ is short for }$ $\forall x , (p(x) \leftrightarrow q(x))$

**Warning:** It is not uncommon for mathematicians to use ( $\rightarrow$ ) and ( $\Rightarrow$ ) interchangeably, as if they mean the same thing.

---

### **Order of Precedence**

This is perhaps best explained by example:

The expression ( $\forall x , (p(x) \rightarrow q(x))$ ) means ( $\forall x$ ).

好的，我会为您解释选定文本中的"优先顺序"概念：

优先顺序是指在逻辑表达式中，不同运算符和量词的执行顺序。这个概念通过一个例子来解释会更清晰：

表达式 ( ⁍ ) 的含义是 (⁍ )。

这个例子说明了量词（如全称量词 ⁍ 或存在量词 ⁍）通常比逻辑连接词（如 ⁍ 或 ⁍）具有更高的优先级。换句话说，量词会先被应用，然后再考虑逻辑连接词。

理解优先顺序对于正确解释复杂的逻辑表达式非常重要，因为它决定了表达式各部分的评估顺序，从而影响整个表达式的含义。
