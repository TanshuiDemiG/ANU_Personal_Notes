### Section A1: Logic (continued) - How to Prove Things

### Introduction

Understanding how to prove statements is fundamental in discrete mathematics. This section focuses on various logical structures and methods to construct proofs.

### Proving Universal Statements (∀)

1. **Structure for ∀x p(x)**
    - **Approach:** Let x be a fixed but arbitrary element of the predicate domain. Argue that p(x) is true.
    - **Example:** Prove that for any integer x, $6x^2 + 4$ is even.
    
    **Steps:**
    
    - Define even and odd integers.
    - Use the even/odd theorem: Every integer is either even or odd, but not both.
    - Proof: Show that 6x^2 + 4 is even by leveraging properties of integers under multiplication and addition.

### Proving Existential Statements (∃)

1. **Structure for ∃x p(x)**
    - **Approach:** Identify a particular element of the predicate domain and establish that p(x) is true.
    - **Example:** Prove that the equation x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 has an integer solution.
    
    **Steps:**
    
    - Identify x = 2 as a solution.
    - Verify by substituting x = 2 into the equation.

### Disproving Universal Statements (∀)

1. **Structure for disproving ∀x p(x)**
    - **Approach:** Prove the statement ∃x¬p(x) by providing a counter example.
    - **Example:** Disprove that for every integer x, (x-1)^2 + (x-1) is positive.
    
    **Steps:**
    
    - Identify x = 0 as a counterexample.
    - Show that (0-1)^2 + (0-1) = 0, which is not positive.

---

### Disproving Existential Statements (∃)

1. **Structure for disproving ∃x p(x)**
    - **Approach:** Prove the statement ∀x¬p(x).
    - **Example:** Disprove the statement ∃y∀x(y ≤ x) for integers.
    
    **Steps:**
    
    - Show that for any integer y, there exists an x such that y > x (e.g., x = y - 1).

---

### Proving Implications (→)

1. **Structure for p → q**
    - **Direct Argument:** Suppose p is true and deduce q.
    - **Contrapositive Argument反证:** Suppose ¬q is true and deduce ¬p.
    
    **Example:** Prove that for all integers x, if x is even, then x^2 + 2 is even.
    
    **Steps:**
    
    - Direct Argument: Assume x is even, show x^2 + 2 is even.
    - Contrapositive Argument: Assume x^2 + 2 is not even, show x is not even (x is odd).

### Proving Biconditionals (↔)

1. **Structure for p ↔ q**
    - Prove both p → q and q → p.
    
    **Example:** Prove that for all integers x, x is even if and only if x^2 + 2 is even.
    
    **Steps:**
    
    - Prove p → q: Assume x is even, show x^2 + 2 is even.
    - Prove q → p via contrapositive: Assume x^2 + 2 is not even, show x is not even.

---

### Arguing by Cases

1. **Structure for proving ∀ statements by cases**
    - Partition the domain into subsets and prove the statement for each subset.
    
    **Example:** Prove that for all integers x, x^2 + x + 6 is even.
    
    **Steps:**
    
    - Case 1: x is even, show x^2 + x + 6 is even.
    - Case 2: x is odd, show x^2 + x + 6 is even.

---

### Proof by Contradiction

1. **Structure for proof by contradiction**
    - Suppose ¬p and deduce a false statement, thereby proving p.
    
    **Example:** Prove that no integers x and y exist such that 5x + 20y = 4.
    
    **Steps:**
    
    - Assume such integers exist.
    - Show that this leads to a contradiction (e.g., 4/5 being an integer).

### General Advice for Constructing Proofs

1. **Identify the logical structure** of the statement to be proved.
2. **Consider your options** for a logical structure that will prove the statement.
3. **Write down the logical structure** of your argument.
4. **Choose the strongest supposition** first when deciding between direct argument and contrapositive.

### Suggested Activities

- Familiarize yourself with ECHO360 system for watching videos.
- Review materials and practice problems for Week 1 on Wattle.
- Prepare for the Week 2 workshop quiz based on Week 1 lectures.
